# role-tailored-portal

Overview
The frontend portal will employ role-based access control (RBAC) to tailor the user experience and functionalities available to Superadmins and Merchant Admins. This approach enhances security and operational efficiency by ensuring users have access to the features they need while protecting sensitive information and critical functionalities.

Superadmin Perspective
Superadmins have the highest level of access, with capabilities to manage and configure system-wide settings, users, and merchant accounts. Their interface includes:

1. System Configuration and Management
Full access to system settings, including fiscal configurations, global VAT rates, and integration settings with third-party services like Greengate.
Ability to configure and update POS system features, including updates and patches.
2. User and Role Management
Creation and management of user accounts across all merchant accounts, with the ability to assign or revoke roles and permissions.
Setup and customization of roles, defining specific permissions for each role within the system.
3. Merchant Account Management
Overview of all merchant accounts registered in the system, with capabilities to add, modify, or deactivate accounts.
Access to aggregated data and reports across all merchants, providing insights into system-wide operations and performance metrics.
4. Support and Maintenance
Dashboard for monitoring system health, including server status, API health checks, and integration status with services like Greengate.
Access to a support ticket system for addressing merchant queries and issues, with oversight on resolution processes and timelines.
Merchant Admin Perspective
Merchant Admins manage day-to-day operations for their specific merchant account. Their interface is focused on operational management, sales, and reporting.

1. Business Configuration
Ability to configure business-specific settings such as business details, tax rates, currency, and payment methods.
Management of terminal settings, including assigning terminals to locations and configuring terminal-specific options like receipt layouts.
2. Product and Inventory Management
Full control over the product catalog, including adding, editing, and removing products or product groups.
Inventory management capabilities, including stock level monitoring and reorder alerts.
3. Order and Sales Management
Access to the POS interface for processing sales, returns, and managing customer orders.
Real-time sales reporting and access to historical sales data, with filters for detailed analysis.
4. Employee Management
Management of employee profiles, including roles specific to the merchant's operations (e.g., cashier, manager).
Assignment of permissions to employees based on their role, controlling access to the POS system functionalities.
5. Reporting and Analytics
Access to business-specific reports and dashboards, including sales performance, popular products, and VAT reporting.
Ability to generate fiscal reports for compliance, utilizing the integration with Greengate for data accuracy.
Common UX/UI Considerations
Both Superadmins and Merchant Admins benefit from a user-centric design approach, including:

Personalized Dashboards: Customizable dashboards that display relevant metrics and notifications based on the user's role.
Intuitive Navigation: Role-based navigation menus that present users with the options relevant to their responsibilities.
Security Measures: Multi-factor authentication, secure sessions, and data encryption to protect sensitive information.
Conclusion
By tailoring the frontend portal functionalities and access controls for Superadmins and Merchant Admins, the POS system ensures that users at different levels of the organization have the tools they need to perform their roles efficiently while maintaining high security and compliance standards. This approach fosters a scalable, user-friendly environment that supports the diverse needs of the F&B industry.
